# CT-OpenLP-Exporter
You always wanted to export your songs directly from ChurchTools to OpenLP?
Just give it a try: https://ctopenlp.joameyer.de
I recommend using id / token login, as this works flawless - also with 2FA enabled - but email / password login is supported as well.

## Self hosting
Just install the files on a webserver supporting `php` and login.
